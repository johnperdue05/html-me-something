        <h1>Things I despise</h1>
        <p>This is a list of a few of the many, many things that annoy me.  They're not given in any particular order; furthermore, these aren't necessarily the things that annoy me <em>most</em> in the world, they're just what came to my mind when I was trying to come up with some things that get on my nerves.  Enjoy!</p>

        <h3>Bad Drivers</h3>
        <p>You're conducting a huge piece of machinery faster than most land animals can run.  You can wait to take that call.  Also, considering that one false move could kill us all or make us vegetables, you could probably stand to use the turn signal and wait your turn to get into the lane.  <span class="insult">Moron.</span></p>

        <h3>Ignorance</h3>
        <p>Not everybody goes to college.  That doesn't make you stupid.  But there are some things everyone should know a little about--like <span title="And what is Aleppo?">current events</span>.</p>
        <h3>Bad Neighbors</h3>
        <p>Hey, do you think you could get rid of the disgusting stained area rug that's crumpled up on the front porch of our two-family unit (that's right, two families live here!)  You know the one, it has the huge pile of junk mail on top of it.  I don't want to be a nuisance; it's just that it makes our building look like a squat for drug addicts and thieves.  Not that that's not appropriate, mind you...it's just that it'd be cool if it didn't <em>look</em> that way.  Since I live upstairs.  And I'm not a lowlife.  Also, would you mind terribly not blowing weed and cigarette smoke through my open windows?  <div class="insult">Kthnxbai.</div></p>

        <h3>Dvorak keyboards</h3>
        <p>Honestly, the Dvorak keyboard itself doesn't bother me.  What bothers me is the difficulty of typing diacriticals.  It's spelled <span id="non-latin">re&#769sume&#769</span>, dammit.</p>
